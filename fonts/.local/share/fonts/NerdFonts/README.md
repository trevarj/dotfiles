# Nerd Font Symbols

This is a font file that only contains the nerd font glyphs for use as a fall
back font.

It is the version [on the
repo](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/NerdFontsSymbolsOnly)
transformed in fontforge:
    - scaled uniformly 64%
    - Move y = 40
    - Transform Width UNCHECKED

This is suitable when using alongside a condensed font like Iosevka.
