# Dotfiles

GNU Stow packages for my Guix System and home environment.

## Requirements

- `fd`
- `stow`
- `bash`

For a temporary Guix environment:

```sh
guix shell bash fd stow -- ./sync.sh
```

## Install

Stow every top-level package into `$HOME`:

```sh
./sync.sh
```

`sync.sh` skips `_untracked` and handles Firefox by stowing into the detected
`default-release` profile's `chrome` directory.

## Remove

Unstow every package:

```sh
./sync.sh -d
```
