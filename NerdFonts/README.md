# Nerd Font Symbols

This is a font file that only contains the nerd font glyphs for use as a fall
back font. 

It is the version [on the
repo](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/NerdFontsSymbolsOnly)
transformed in fontforge:
    - scaled 75%
    - shifted -2 on the y-axis

This is suitable when using a condensed font like Iosevka.
